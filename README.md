# Rookie on Quest for Quest 2 🛡️
What is this?
This is a game downloader and auto-sideloading app for Quest 2, 3, and 3S. While it has a completely different look and feel compared to [Rookie on Quest](https://github.com/LeGeRyChEeSe/rookie-on-quest/tree/main/app), it retains all essential features while removing unnecessary bloat to focus on simple downloading, installing, and browsing.

# Features
Browse a Huge Library: Access the massive database of games handled by Rookie Sideloader, ensuring all game listings stay up to date.

Game Donations: Contribute to the community! If you have a game that isn't in the database (and isn't uncrackable), you can upload it directly to the servers so this app gives back to the ecosystem.

Auto Sideload: When enabled, the app will prompt you to install the APK (manual) and then automatically sideload the OBB folder, completing the installation for you.

Background & Queue System: Download games in the background while you continue to browse. You can add multiple games to a queue; the app will automatically start the next download once the current one finishes.

Buttery Smooth: Optimized specifically for the Quest 2 to eliminate the lag and crashes found in other loaders. Includes full metadata support, images, clickable game cards for notes, and background syncing.

Faster Downloads & Extraction: Uses a native rclone binary for direct server connections (faster than standard HTTP) and a native 7z binary for lightning-fast extraction with minimal CPU usage.

Local Cache: Metadata is saved locally after the first launch for near-instant startup. The app performs a quick background sync every time it opens to check for new updates and releases.

# 🛠️ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the app running on your headset:

Get your VR Ready: Ensure your Quest 2, 3, or 3S is powered on and Developer Mode is enabled.

Download the Latest Release: Navigate to the Releases page and download the latest .apk file.

Sideload the App: Use a file explorer like Mobile VR Station or Cx File Explorer (recommended) to install the APK onto your headset.

Grant Permissions: Open the app and accept all file permissions.

Note: This is required to allow the app to write game files and OBBs to your storage, exactly how Rookie on Quest functions.

Finalize Setup: Quit the app after the initial setup is complete, then relaunch it.

Browse and Play: You’re all set! Browse the library, manage your queue, and start sideloading directly from your headset.

# Disclaimer ⚠️
Device Compatibility: While this app is compatible with all modern Quest devices (Quest 3/3S), it was specifically built and optimized for the Quest 2. Our goal is to ensure Quest 2 users experience zero lag, though users on higher-end headsets will obviously enjoy a great experience as well.

Minimalist Design: This app follows a "function over form" philosophy. Do not expect the same complex UI elements found in Rookie on Quest. Instead, this app provides a clean, lightweight, and stable experience that keeps all the features you actually need.
