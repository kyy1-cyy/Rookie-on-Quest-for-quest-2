# Rookie on Quest for Quest 2🛡️

# What is this
this is a rookie sideloader games downloader and auto sideload app for quest 2/3s/3. This app has a compelly different look and feel to [Rookie on Quest](https://github.com/LeGeRyChEeSe/rookie-on-quest/tree/main/app). But has all of the features minising some tha serve no purpose for simple downloaing/install/browsing games

# Features
- **Browse a huge libary of vr games**: browse a huge database of games that rookie sideloader handle. this makes it so all games our app to date
- **Game Donations**: rookie realise and game donations for nearly every game. this means you can click the button. choose one of your games thats not in the database already/isnt uncrackable. then it will be uplaoded to rookies server so this app isnt just using there servers without doing anything like rookie on quest
- **Auto Sideload**: with this feature turned on. When games are done installing if this slider is turned on it will first promt you to install the apk (manual) then it will sideload the obb folder (auto) finishing the games instalation
- **Background and Queue system**: this app like rookie on quest supports allowing the user to click on the background button which lets the download happen in the backgroudn while they get to browse games. it also allows for queue system. just click another game while installing the first one and it will be added to the queue and will start downloaing once the first one is done.
- **Smooth**: Main reason this app was mad, rookie on quest has terrible optimization when it comes to quest 2. its very laggy and sometimes crashes. this app covers all meta data including images, clickable game cards for checking notes, game data, background syncing for new games. all while staying buttery smooth as the way the app was made.
- **Faster downloads and Extraction**: rookie on quest downloads and extraction are very different to this app. rookie streams the app in one go and extraction is longer. this app has a whole lot faster downloads as it uses a native rclone binary connecting the rooies servers using rclone binary instead of http. this app also has a 7z binary which menas extraction is way faster with a native binary locally making it faster and less cpu usage
- **Local Cache**: once the app first extracts games it downloads all meta data locally makeing it instant startup next time you relaunch the app. it then runs backgrounds syncs eveytime the app is open to check for new games and updates.

# Disclaimer ⚠️
Device Compatibility: While this app is compatible with all modern Quest devices such as q3s/q3, it was specifically optimized for the Quest 2. Our goal is to ensure Quest 2 users experience zero lag and a perfectly smooth interface while browsing so quest 2 and above will have obviously a better experience.

Minimalist Design: This app follows a "function over form" philosophy. Do not expect the same flashy or complex UI elements found in Rookie on Quest. Instead, this app provides a clean, nice, and lightweight experience that focuses on stability and getting the job done but keeping alot of features.
